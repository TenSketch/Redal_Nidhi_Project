                            applications to respond to the Customer as an individual. The web application can tailor its
                            operations to the needs of the Customer, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering
                            information about the preferences of the Customer. We use traffic log cookies to identify
                            which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve
                            our website in order to tailor it to needs of the Customer. We only use this information for

                            useful to the Customer and which pages are not. A cookie does not give us access to the
                            Customer’s computer or any information about the Customer, other than the data chosen by the
                            Customer to be shared with us. A Customer can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web
                            browsers automatically accept cookies, but a Customer can usually modify the browser setting
                            to decline cookies if preferred. This may prevent a Customer from taking full advantage of
                            the website.
